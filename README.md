# Tchaikovsky-The-Seasons
This project is one of my hometasks for <a href='https://github.com/kottans'>Kottans</a> frontend <a href='https://github.com/Kottans/frontend'>course</a>.</br> 
It was create to help my daughter to prepare for her exams at music school by using associations of melody with the name of the composition.</br>
I've used here my knowledges about HTML dom, dynamicaly created elements, event delegation, responsive web design, working with images and sounds content.

Enjoy the beauty of classic music with this project. 
It is adapted for mobile devices</br>
